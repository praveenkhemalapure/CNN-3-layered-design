# CNN-3-layered-design

1. cnn.v is the design file which handles 3 layered covolution of raw inputs and weights.
2. X_bin_signed_bin.mif is the memory initial file for raw inputs used to load the data into rom on FPGA board.
3. Similarly, T1 and T2 mif files are the memory inital format file for weights.
4. Report file shows how the design is implemented in altera FPGA board and results.
